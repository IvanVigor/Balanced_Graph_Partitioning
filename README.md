### Project: Balanced Graph Partitioning
Accademic year 2016/17, course "Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming"
Code authors: Lorenzo Frigerio, Ivan Vigorito


## Installation Windows 

The code wast tested with python 3.5 with these additional libraries:
- numpy
- networkx
- python-igraph

In order to install them:

1) Open Python console 
2) write "pip install numpy" and wait termination
3) write "pip install networkx" and wait termination
4) write "pip install python-igraph" and wait termination
	In case of failure of this last step:
		1) go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-igraph
		2) write in python console: "pip install path/to/igraph.whl"



		
## Installation Linux 

The code wast tested with Python 2.7.11 because igraph library is not compatible with
Python 2.7+ versions.

# Requirements
On Linux (and other Unix-like systems), you will need a C and a C++ compiler, the tool 
"make" and the development header files for your version of Python. On Debian and Ubuntu 
Linux the "build-essential" and "python-dev" packages.

The code run with these additional libraries:

- numpy
- networkx
- python-igraph

1) Open Python console 
2) write "pip install numpy" and wait termination
3) write "pip install networkx" and wait termination [remember to install the library in the right Python version (2.7)]
4) write "pip install python-igraph" and wait termination
	In case of failure of this last step:
		1) check "# Requirements"
		2) follow instructions on this page http://igraph.wikidot.com/installing-python-igraph-on-linux
		[Ubuntu Linux version tested by us]
